# A comment, this is so you can read your program later.
# Anything after the # is ignored by Ruby.

puts "I could have code like this." # And the comment after is ignored

# You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out a piece of code:
# puts "This won't run."

puts "This will run."

# Now I want to try what happens if the # symbol is inside the "" double quotes...
puts "Aha!! let's try this # NOW!"

# In conclusion... the quotes have priority over the pound sign.
